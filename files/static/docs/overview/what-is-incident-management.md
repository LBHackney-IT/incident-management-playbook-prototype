# What is incident management?

Incident management is the process of detection, recovery and resolution of a service following some form of service outage.

The process encompasses:

- **Response** – how a team responds to an incident occurring
- **Resolution** – how a team restores access to a service
- **Improvement** – how a team learns from an incident to better themselves and their service
