# Incident management roles

There are a handful of roles that you will likely need during any incident. They are described below.

> **Note:** it's worth remembering that roles are _not_ individuals. Depending on the timing and nature of your incident, you may find different people fill these roles. If it's a long incident, you may find that people swap in and out of roles during the same incident. What is important is that someone takes ownership of each role's responsibilities.

| Role                       | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident manager**       | This role maintains overall responsibility and authority during the incident. They will take the necessary action to resolve the incident, for example bringing in additional support, and helps to maintain focus of those working on a resolution.                                                                 |
| **Tech lead**              | Helps to gather the team, gives them guidance and helps them to develop theories around what might be broken, and how we can fix them. Will be the key point of contact for the incident manager.                                                                                                                    |
| **Communications manager** | The individual in this role will be comfortable writing and shaping comunications, and will work closely with senior stakeholders and / or customer services to create them. They ensure that any communication update times are met with meaningful updates.                                                        |
| **Postmortem owner**       | This role ensures that a useful postmortem is run within a few days of the incident resolution. They may have held one of the above roles during the incident, or they may not. Either way, they ensure that the team gets together and compiles a list of lessons and actions, as per the [postmortem](#) guidance. |

## Other roles

You will likely have a handful of other people involved during an incident, and though they don't have named roles, they are just as important.

Other roles may include:

- Technical support / engineer (usually reporting to the Tech Lead)
- Domain knowledge expert (to help propose workarounds to partial outages, and will be useful to the Incident Manager)
- Customer support (who will likely work closely with the Communications Manager)
