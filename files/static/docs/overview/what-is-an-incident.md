# What is an incident?

An incident is usually understood as any time some or all of a system is partially or entirely unavailable for end users.

Incidents are an inevitability of running production software systems. No matter how much effort and energy a team spends, eventually an incident _will_ take down some or all of their service.

Good incident management is critical to the mitigation of this inevitability. If the process is clear, predictable, and easy to follow, then the team will be well placed to reduce down time and improve the experience of their users and stakeholders.

An incident might be identified through:

- Customer / user reports
- Internal alerting and monitoring
- A team member discovering an issue

## Priority

In almost all cases, an incident is something that should be addressed immediately, above all other work. When considering how important your incident is, consider the following:

- How many users are affected? (1 or 1,000?)
- How severe is impact? (slow pages or total outage?)
- Do you have any pre-agreed SLAs around the uptime or response time of this service? (1 hour or 1 week?)
