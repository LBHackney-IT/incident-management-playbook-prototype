# The incident lifecycle

All incidents, no matter how large or small, follow the same lifecycle, defined below.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Stage</th>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Respond</td>
            <td>1. Detection</td>
            <td>We know about the issue before our users do and communicate effectively (internally, and with our users)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. Start communications</td>
            <td>We open a communication channel with the relevant parties</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Resolve</td>
            <td>3. Repair</td>
            <td>We restore access to the service</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Resolution</td>
            <td>We resolve the issue and any resultant impact</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">Improve</td>
            <td>5. Learn</td>
            <td>We run a postmortem to develop insight and learning from the incident</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6. Act</td>
            <td>We act on our learnings to improve the service and our incident response process for the future</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

> **Note:** It is likely that as a team follows a process of hypothesise, investigate and learn, they will cycle through stages 3 and 4, and regularly update their stakeholders through communications.
